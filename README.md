# Learn To Code: Visual Assistant
A video player designed to assist visually impaired developers who want to learn to code. The program reads code from video to assist visually impaired developers in using such resources.

## Requirements
### Persona
A visually impaired individual wanting to learn the fundamentals of programming. They find that when they listen to YouTube coding videos the narrator often doesn't say out loud the parts that are crucial for reproducing the code.

### Proposal
Create a video player that allows such personas to pause the video and then read out the portions of the screen that contain code.

### MVP
OCR a frame of an mp4 video and print the text that is OCRd. The frame should be optimized to have the best chance of being OCRd

##### Nice to have's
- Work directly with YouTube.
- Identify the portion of the screen that contains code and only OCR that portion.
- Identify code as code and ensure it is properly formatted.
